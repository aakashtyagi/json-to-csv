# json-to-csv

This project converts JSON to CSV file that's saved in the project directory.

There's 2 options:

1. For Python
- Clone the repository / Copy the Python file
- Run "python jsontocsv.py" from your command shell (Works for Python 2.x)
- CSV file will be created

2. For Ruby
- Clone the repository / Copy the Ruby file
- Run "ruby jsontocsv.rb" from your command shell (Tested for ruby 2.0.0p648)
- CSV file will be created

Thanks for trying it out!
